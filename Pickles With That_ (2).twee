:: Fine. I will get pickles! [END] {"position":"1475,650","size":"100,100"}
Sussy-Loowho doesn't like your tone. 

*Scary demon monsters appear from nowhere & carry you out of the resturant, then throw you on the strange looking ground. Sussy-Loowho stands over you and throws a gallon of pickle chips on to your head. You're soaked in pickle juice.* 


''GAME OVER.'' 


:: Go out and explore. [TO-BE-CONTINUED] {"position":"50,750","size":"100,100"}
TO BE CONTINUED.


:: I will have the Cheesy Dog Burber and a kiwi soda, please {"position":"425,725","size":"100,100"}



:: I work for NASA and we are going to the moon! Thought I might stop here, its been a long day. {"position":"900,300","size":"100,100"}
Wow! Aren't you a smarty-genius pants! You must be really hungry from using all that brain power of yours. Want to see a menu?

[[Yeah, being a smarty-genius pants really wears me out. I'd love to see a menu. Thanks.]]

[[Mmmm. Im not very hungry.]]


:: I'm not sure. *Scratches head* I just appeared here. I am really confused. {"position":"575,325","size":"100,100"}
Rut-Roo. That doesn't sound too good. Lets try and figure this out together, I have nothing better to do. I'm Sussy-Loowho by the way. *Sussy-Loowho reaches out her purple hand for a hand shake*

[[Could I just see a menu? Im starving.]]

or 

[[Shake Sussy-Loowho's freaky looking hand and keep trying to figure out what happened to you.]]


:: Interesting. I'll take one of each! {"position":"1550,300","size":"100,100"}
Sounds great! Is everything on all of the iteams okay?

[[Yes. Everything is good.]]
or 
[[No Pickles on anything. Thank you.]]


:: It's really not the big of a deal. I just don't like pickles [END] {"position":"1600,650","size":"100,100"}
YOU DON"T LIKE PICKLES. EVERYONE LIKES PICKLES. THAT IS INSULTING. IT IS A BIG DILL!!! 

*Scary demon monsters appear from nowhere & carry you out of the resturant, then throw you on the strange looking ground. Sussy-Loowho stands over you and throws a gallon of pickle chips on to your head. You're soaked in pickle juice.* 


''GAME OVER.'' Why don't you like pickles. Its literaly in the title of this, you should have gotten pickles.


:: LOOKS SO AMAZING! [TO-BE-CONTINUED] {"position":"1825,650","size":"100,100"}
You are beyond pleased with your meal and service! 

Someone spawns in and is not sitting next to you. 

TO BE CONTINUED


:: Look around awkwardly waiting for Sussy-Loowho to come back. {"position":"650,725","size":"100,100"}



:: Mmmm. Im not very hungry. [END] {"position":"1075,500","size":"100,100"}
Well thats fruckin weird. You should go. 

*Scary demon monsters appear from nowhere & carry you out of the resturant, then throw you on the strange looking ground* 


''GAME OVER.'' Why would you go to a resturant on Saturn and tell the waitress you aren't hungry? Weird AF. 


:: No Pickles on anything. Thank you. {"position":"1550,475","size":"100,100"}
Are you sure you do not want pickles on any of the items? That quite strange. Everyone here loves pickles. *Sussy-Loowho (Waitress) pans to the empty resturant to show "everyone" who loves pickles.*

[[It's really not the big of a deal. I just don't like pickles]]

[[Fine. I will get pickles!]]


:: One of everything, and a fishy soda. Please. {"position":"250,600","size":"100,100"}
Wow what a great choice! 

3 minutes later. 

*Sussy-Loowho brings you all of your food and a fishy soda. You quickly scarf up ALL of the food.*

The ground starts to shake. The walls start to rattle. Your food falls off the table. Sussy-Loowho looks terrified, she takes cover. You freeze in your seat. 

You notice five rovers drive up to Lucky's and stop outside. 

[[Go out and explore.]]

[[Run for cover and hope they don't notice you.]]


:: Run for cover and hope they don't notice you. [TO-BE-CONTINUED] {"position":"150,875","size":"100,100"}
TO BE CONTINUED


:: Shake Sussy-Loowho's freaky looking hand and keep trying to figure out what happened to you. {"position":"650,450","size":"100,100"}
You and Sussy-Loowho chat it up trying to figure out how you got there. 
Blah blah blah blah. 
You two still cant figure it out. Sussy-Loowho is starting to get annoyed with you. She really wants you to order something but you are so distracted of how you got to Lucky's. 

*Sussy-Loowho walks away. A blue being walks through the way and looks at you with intense eye contact. You are frozen.*

[[Try and interact witht his blue being.]]

or 

[[Look around awkwardly waiting for Sussy-Loowho to come back.]]


:: Start {"position":"975,50","size":"100,100"}
Welcome to Luckys! What can I get started for you today? 
[[Where the FRICK am I?]] or [[Could I see a menu first, please?]]



:: This was not what I was exspecting.. [Good] {"position":"1975,650","size":"100,100"}
The food wasn't what you were exspecting but you decide to FEAST anyways! 


:: Try and interact witht his blue being. {"position":"775,575","size":"100,100"}



:: Uhh. We are like a bagillion miles away from another resturant and this is all you have? [END] {"position":"1275,300","size":"100,100"}
Well I am not a fan of that attitude my friend. Do NOT be rude to little Sussy-Loowho. How dare you. 

*Scary demon monsters appear from nowhere & carry you out of the resturant, then throw you on the strange looking ground* 


''GAME OVER.'' How could you be rude to little Sussy-Loowho. You are no longer welcome back to Luckys or Saturn. Period. 


:: Where the FRICK am I? {"position":"750,200","size":"100,100"}
You're confused where you are? Hmmm. Strange. Well I guess I will tell you. You are at Luckys on Saturn. We are the only spaceship stop on the WHOLE PLANET! Not many people pass by. How did you get here exactly? 
[[I'm not sure. *Scratches head* I just appeared here. I am really confused.]] 
or 
[[I work for NASA and we are going to the moon! Thought I might stop here, its been a long day.]]


:: Yeah, being a smarty-genius pants really wears me out. I'd love to see a menu. Thanks. {"position":"950,500","size":"100,100"}
Of course you can! 

Weiny Dog - $14.99

Octo Fries - $20.00

Cheesy Dog Burber - $17.99

:: Yes. Everything is good. {"position":"1800,475","size":"100,100"}
While you wait for your food, you and Sussy-Loowho chat it up. Blah blah blah blah. 
4 minutes later! 

*Sussy-Loowho brings you a Weiny Dog, Octo-Fries, and a Cheesy Dog Burber*

(You notice that HEAPING amount of pickles on each of the items. The weiny dog was more pickle spears than anything else, the octo-fries are only pickle slices... and the cheesy dog burber has a pickle patty.) 

Sussy-Loowho asks you if everyone looks good. 

[[This was not what I was exspecting..]]
or 
[[LOOKS SO AMAZING!]]
